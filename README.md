# Bondible
*This is a hackathon project, please be aware of this when using the project*

Bondible is a dApp that allows a user to create a bond as a smart contract and raise funds through that contract. Within the form, they set conditions such as the max subscription, bond term and rate of interest. Upon submitting the form, Bondible creates a smart contract for the user to provide to third-parties to raise funds. 

Democratizing corporate financing and making it easier to raise money without going through banks is a way small business owners in Africa can raise money.
